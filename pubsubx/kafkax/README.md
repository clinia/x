Code taken from [nachogiljaldo's work on watermill-kafka](https://github.com/nachogiljaldo/watermill-kafka/tree/374-allow_concurrent_consumption_of_events).

Since his [pull request](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-kafka/pull/29) made onto the base watermill-kafka repository was not merged yet and there seems to be no activity by the repository owners, we copied the code over to this `kafkax` package to allow for concurrent consumption of events, which is exactly the feature we needed.
